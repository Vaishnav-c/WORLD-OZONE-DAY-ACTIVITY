    <h1 id="h1">What is World Ozone Day?</h1><br><br>
    <p>
        On September 16, 1987, the United Nations and 45 other countries signed
        the Montreal Protocol, on substances that deplete the Ozone layer.The
        purpose of the Montreal Protocol is to protect the Ozone layer by reducing
        the production of substances that are supposed to be responsible for ozone
        layer depletion.This year, we celebrate 35 years of the Vienna Convention and 35 years of global ozone layer
        protection. Life on Earth would not be possible without sunlight. But the energy emanating from the sun would be
        too much for life on Earth to thrive were it not for the ozone layer. This stratospheric layer shields Earth
        from most of the sun’s harmful ultraviolet
Sunlight makes life possible, but the ozone layer makes
        life as we know it possible. So, when scientists working in the late 1970s discovered that humanity was creating
        a hole in this protective shield, they raised the alarm. The hole – caused by ozone-depleting gases (ODSs) used
        in aerosols and cooling, such as refrigerators and air-conditioners – was threatening to increase cases of skin
        cancer and cataracts, and damage plants, crops, and ecosystems.
